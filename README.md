# Internship Project <br>
## MotoGP rider analysis

Author: Zheng Jing <br>
Programming Language 1: Python (.ipynb) <br>
Programming Language 2: R (.rmd) <br>

## Goals

for all races and all riders, we

​ a) implemented the predator index and prey index

​ b) implemented the net index, volatility index, and efficiency index

​ c) developed weighted predator & prey indexes (additional weight & exponential weight)

​ d) implemented summary statistics & data aggregation

​ e) visualizaions of riders' annual trajectory (2015 - 2019)

## Indexes Description & Algorithm design
copy paste


## Data
https://www.motogp.com/en/Results+Statistics <br>
All the data (lap charts) are collected from MotoGP official website. <br>


## Methodology

​ a) data cleaning 

​ b) data aggregation (tables) <br>

** by looking at the summary table, we are able to break down riders' performance in parts: offensive, defensive, volatility, and efficiency move, grid position (determiend by qualifying race), and final position **

- compute the summary statitics - grouped by rider, rider and year, rider and circuit...

​ c) plot graphs <br>
 
- efficiency vs volatility, e.g. Joan Mir (rookie) vs Alex Rins (veteran) <br>
- annual trajectory + Circuit difficulty <br>

## Conclusion & Analysis
